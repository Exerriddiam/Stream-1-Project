# Stream 1 Project

### What is the purpose of this website?

This website has two purposes, first of all, this website has been created as a project for my online course at the Code Institute to show my ability to create a website using the front end tools I have been taught on my course.

Secondly this website has been created for a good friend whos has a band and was in need of a website to advertise what he and his fellow muscian play and what they are about and there services.

## Testing and Errors Fixed and on going. 


	-Content would hide behind my footer.

	-Toggoling the responsive navbar wouldn't work as it was all ready in full view, ie not hidden and would not hide when clicked.
	 **FIXED**, by adding collapsed to the navbar-toggle class fixed this.

	-Issue with how the toggle button looked after I had edited some code in CSS.
	**FIXED**, by removing the width and height values placed on the button element.

	-Issue with text not appearing.
	**FIXED**, by adding a background so that text became visible again.

	-Issue with page layout and dissappearance of styling and imagery after placing HTML pages into a seperate folder.
	**FIXED**, by adding (/..) after image locations and that of Jquery and css folder locations.

	-Issue with parts of the page missing and having to scroll to see the rest of the site.
	**Fixed, by changing the navbar size and formating of margins and padding too.

	-more formating of div sizes for example the about page, it deosnt look quite right.
	**FIXED** just changed the overal size of the div boxs

	-Issue with about pages content coming into contact with the sides of the window causeing jerky scrolling.
	**Fixed** as mentioned above, this was due to the size of the divs.

	-Issue with fine tuning of divs scrolling on and off the page.I might remove this.
	**FIXED** this was more a UX issue and decided to remove this for the better.
