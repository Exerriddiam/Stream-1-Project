# Stream 1 Project

## Overview

### What is the purpose of this website?

This website has two purposes, first of all, this website has been created as a project for my online course at the Code Institute to show my ability to create a website using the front end tools I have been taught on my course.

Secondly this website has been created for a good friend whos has a band and was in need of a website to advertise what he and his fellow muscian play and what they are about and there services.

### What does this site do?

This website will allow the user to browse for more information on the band, view pictures and videos that show the clients abilities, whilst also opening up a avenue for direct communication to my client for future bookings for the users needs, ultimately providing a service to the user for events and opening more possibilties for possible events to add to my clients profits.

	**FIXED**, by removing the width and height values placed on the button element.
